# Libre-6502

This is a simple free/libre emulation library for executing 6502 machine code. The 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor
utilized in consoles such as the NES and the Atari and in home computers such as the Apple II and the BBC Micro.
It started out as project for full NES emulation, but I decided to limit its scope to just the processor because
I found it to be the most interesting and least soul-crushing part to implement.

You could use this as a component of a full emulator, and, in fact, I plan to this at some point in the future,
but I wouldn't really recommend it. I think of this repository as more of a learning experience for myself and,
hopefully, to any potential reader. The 6502 instruction set is just a joy to understand and implement and
I had a lot of fun with this thing,
